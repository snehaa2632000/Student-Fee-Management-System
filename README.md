# Student-Fee-Management-System
This flask application with database is developed with basic HTML and CSS helps calculate the fee to be paid by a student studying in college. The application allows users to add/remove/update a student's details and also calculate the (remaining)fee to be paid by the student studying at college.

Files required to be deploy in Amazon ECS are available too. Make sure to give the respective docker image names before trying to deploy in ecs.
